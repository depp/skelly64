# Bitmap Example

This is a subset of the [Terminus][terminus] font, rendered at size 12. The build scripts and data used to create this example are in the [examples/font_bitmap][font_bitmap] folder.

[terminus]: http://terminus-font.sourceforge.net/
[font_bitmap]: https://github.com/depp/skelly64/tree/main/examples/font_bitmap

The font data takes only 1152 bytes in your ROM image, and doesn’t require any additional RAM at runtime. This means that your debug logger or crash screen doesn’t need to use up much of your precious memory.
