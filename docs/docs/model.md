# Model Converter

Model Converter converts models from standard formats like FBX to formats suitable for the Nintendo 64.

## Input Formats

Model Converter supports the FBX format for input.

The model converter uses the [Open Asset Import Library][assimp], and in theory, can use other formats that the Open Asset Import Library supports. However, **this is not tested.**
