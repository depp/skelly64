# Skelly 64

Skelly 64 is a set of tools for creating assets for homebrew Nintendo 64 games.

## These Tools Don’t Work!

This project is a work in progress. Skelly 64 is just not complete, or very usable yet. The tools were designed to be used in a game for the N64Brew Jam in 2020, and it will take time to document these tools, fix some bugs, and make them work for more general cases. While I’d like to make these tools usable for your project, these tools aren’t really ready yet! That’s why I’m creating these docs.

I’m looking forward to removing this section from the docs.

## Homebrew, or ROM Hack?

Skelly 64 is only designed to help you create new homebrew games, it won’t help you make ROM hacks, it won't help you modify existing games, and it won't help you use textures or models from old Nintendo 64 games.

A **homebrew** game is a completely new game for the Nintendo 64, made long after the console was no longer supported. This means new code, new sound, new graphics.

A **ROM hack** is a modification to an old Nintendo 64 game, like _Super Mario 64_ or _Ocarina of Time._

ROM hacks and homebrew games are just too different from each other. With homebrew games, you are free to design the game however you want, and Skelly 64 will help. However, if you are working on a ROM hack, you have to work with the existing formats used in old Nintendo 64 games. Skelly 64 does not support these formats, and support for these old formats will never be added.
